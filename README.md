**How sound-proof is the Glass Ceiling? - Analyzing female representation in English-speaking written media**

Abstract:
A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

While the answer to the overarching question of whether men and women are unevenly represented in media may be easily answered and dismissed due to the general imbalance of gender in positions of power or influence, a more in depth analysis lends itself to give a diversified picture on the question. Quotebank covering a representative portion of the media landscape thanks to the extracted quotes in conjuction with the speaker and the journal allows to investigate female representation in a more fine-grained manner. The proportion of cited women changing over a timeline and topics for which women are cited most often give an early descriptive insight. Beyond this, meta-data about the journals themselves, such as their political stance of the paper or the gender of (chief-)editors may allow for further insights on female representation in media and thus for a a more targeted approach to make female voices equally heard accross domains. 

Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.

**Meta Analysis of Media**

- Proportion of female chief-editors in media mentioned quotebank
    - Weighted after readership
    - Political Spectrum
    - Theme
    - total

**Quote Issuers Analysis**

- Proportion of females quoted in entirety of quotebank
    - Fine grained analysis across different topics of quotes
        - International affairs, politics, tech, finance, “neighbourhood stories”, science,...
        - Types of journals 
        - Size (global, national, local distribution of medium)
        - Political affiliation - based on (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/)
    - Language women use in quotes
        - Topic analysis: What do women speak about?
        - Sentiment analysis: How do women speak about things? Positively, negatively,... 

    - Timeline of effects

**Quote Analysis specifically considering men/women - third dimension as a bonus **

- Language by which women are addressed within quote
    - “woman/girl” vs “man/boy” count
    - most common words (apart from linkers) used in quotes where women are mentioned versus men - Does this allow for some portrayal of genders into certain stereotypes?
