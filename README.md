Show that:
    That you can handle the data in its size.
    That you understand what’s in the data (formats, distributions, missing values, correlations, etc.).
    That you considered ways to enrich, filter, transform the data according to your needs.
    That you have a reasonable plan and ideas for methods you’re going to use, giving their essential mathematical details in the notebook.
    That your plan for analysis and communication is reasonable and sound, potentially discussing alternatives to your choices that you considered but dropped.


**How sound-proof is the Glass Ceiling? - Analyzing female representation in English-speaking written media**

Abstract:
A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

While the answer to the overarching question of whether men and women are unevenly represented in media may be easily answered and dismissed due to the general imbalance of gender in positions of power, influence or public spaces a more in depth analysis lends itself to give a diversified picture on the question. Quotebank covering a representative portion of the media landscape thanks to the extracted quotes in conjuction with the speaker and the journal allows is an ideal tool to investigate female representation. The proportion of cited women changing over a timeline and topics for which women are cited most often give an early descriptive insight. Beyond this, meta-data about the journals themselves, such as their political stance or the gender of (chief-)editors may allow for a diversified account on the question.



    Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
    Proposed additional datasets (if any): List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.
